### Hey!

I'm Skye. You may know me as Lisena (or lisenaaaa), which is the name I use online in most places.

I'm learning Rust (the programming language, not the game), and I used to play Minecraft, which is why my current main project is [a Minecraft mod installer](https://github.com/Lisenaaaa/modpm), with [over 200 downloads on crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/modpm)

My pronouns are **she/her**, and I'm a trans lesbian girl.

I used to work on a Discord bot (which I called Rain), but at some point I just sorta gave up on that.
